## What It Is

CalcFoundry is a library of engineering calculation tools built to solve common technical problems with precision and reliability. The project focuses on creating well-documented, tested utilities that engineers and technicians can trust for field calculations.

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates skills valuable in field service and technical support:

- **Engineering Precision**: Building tools that require accuracy and attention to detail
- **Documentation Excellence**: Every function is documented with usage examples and edge cases
- **Systematic Approach**: Problems are broken down into clear, testable components
- **Practical Tooling**: Focused on real-world applications engineers actually need

## Tech & Tools

- Python (core library)
- Unit testing (pytest)
- Technical documentation (Markdown, docstrings)
- Version control (Git)

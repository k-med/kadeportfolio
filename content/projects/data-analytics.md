## What It Is

A data analytics project focused on building reporting dashboards and automated data pipelines. The work involved extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into meaningful metrics, and presenting it through interactive Power BI dashboards for business decision-making.

## Why It Matters

This project showcases skills that apply directly to technical support and application support:

- **Structured Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex data problems into manageable steps

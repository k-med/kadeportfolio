## What It Is

UtterOn is a language learning platform I designed and built to help learners practice speaking through structured sentence modules, vocabulary builders, and spaced repetition. The platform focuses on practical, real-world phrases organized by use case — from social conversations to troubleshooting scenarios.

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates skills directly relevant to technical support roles:

- **Structured Thinking**: Organized complex content into intuitive, navigable modules
- **User-Focused Design**: Built the interface around real user needs and learning patterns
- **Technical Documentation**: Created clear, scannable content that helps users achieve goals quickly
- **Problem-Solving**: Iterated on design based on feedback and usability testing

## Tech & Tools

- Hugo (static site generator)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- CSS (custom design system)
- Audio integration (text-to-speech)
- LocalStorage for progress tracking
